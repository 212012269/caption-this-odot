# Day 3: `github-games`

### What we did in class today:
- We worked on another, third repository.
  - Just like the merge conflict repository, everyone has their own repository, and we will run scripts against it to track your progress. (Don't you love automation? :robot:)
- We worked through more advanced Git problems and solutions including (but not limited to :wink:)
  - GitHub Flow
  - Atomic commits
  - `git revert` and changing history
  - `git log` and aliases

### Day 3 Partner Activity

Instead of working with one partner, you'll work in a small group. Discuss what you have learned and how it will impact their workflows. Not sure where to start? Here are some conversation seeds to plant:
- What is a branch, really?
- How is branching cheap?
- What is master?
- When and why should you create a new branch, even when you are working alone?
- What happens when you create a branch?
- What happens when you are done with a branch?
- What is an example of a perfect pull request?
