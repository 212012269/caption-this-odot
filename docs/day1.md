# Day 1: Getting Started with GitHub Flow

### What we did in class today:
- We worked in the class repository together.
- We talked about [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
- You commented on a designated issue with the topic of your slide deck. This issue had instructions for how to complete the activity.
- You cloned the repository locally, and [got the site set up to build locally](https://github.com/githubtraining/caption-this#instructions-local-setup).
- You completed the steps of the GitHub Flow to create the first page of the slide deck.
  - Creating a branch
  - Making (a) commit(s)
- You created a pull request.

### Day 1 Partner Activity

#### Hello, Partner!
Your partner for today will be working with you through these activities. Maybe you know them already, or maybe you get to meet someone new! :wave: :octocat:
  - _Description of how partners are assigned_
  - _Description of how partners interaction is structured. Is this in zoom? Is it timeboxed? What if their partner is unavailable?_


#### 1. Complete a code review of someone else's another's slide file.
  - Since you're partnered, and everyone wants a review, both you and your partner should complete a review of different pull requests.
  - Find an open pull request with no review in the class repository
  - Leave a review of the changes within the pull request (Not sure how? [Click here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/) for more information.)

#### 2. With your partner, pick another open issue to work on together. These tasks could be creating more slides, adding a new layout, or adding tests.
  - Together, go through the steps of the GitHub flow as pair programmers.
  - We recommend one person 'driving', who shares their screen and controls the activity. The other partner watches, asks questions, and engages as the driver explains their actions out loud.
  - GitHub is meant to be collaborative! This means, if one person wants to create the branch and the other person wants to make a commit on the same branch, that's OK!
