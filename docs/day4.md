# Day 4: Local Practice

### What we did in class today:
- We worked in brand new, local only repositories
- We covered advanced topics that have to do with Git under the hood
  - `git init`
  - What's really in the `.git` folder
  - `git reset`, all three types (`--soft`, `--mixed`, & `--hard`)
  - `git cherry-pick`
  - `git reflog`
  - `git rebase
- When to change history, and how
